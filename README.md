# memory-click-nba
* Test your memory by playing Memory Click NBA, the memory game for NBA enthusiasts. 
* The goal is to click all 12 images of an NBA card without clicking the same card twice. 
* If you click the same card twice, your score reverts back to zero and you will have to start over.
* The top score is tallied in the top right corner of the navbar until the page is refreshed.
* Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention. The hard part is that after a card is clicked the cards refshuffle to a new order.
* Good luck!
